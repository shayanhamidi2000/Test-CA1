# Test-CA1
This Project is a fork of standard spring framework example project.A bunch of unit tests were implemented with different techniques.
1. Using assertions and result verifications for the first time in tests. 
2. Using our basic knowledge to implement simple tests in Owner Class.
3. Using Theory method to implement tests in Pet Class and Owner Class.
4. Using Parametrized testing to implement tests in PetService Class.
5. Getting challenged with dependencies setup in PetService Class.
